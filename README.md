# Calculator

A fully working basic calculator.

I learned how to successfully use HTML, CSS and Javascript together to make a functioning calculator. The user clicks the buttons and uses a specific function such as addition, subtraction, division and multiplication. I did run into small issues while degugging but I learned to step back and see where I made my mistakes with the code. Overall this project was one of my top 6 projects at The Tech Academy because this project brought together many lessons I had learned over a months time.
